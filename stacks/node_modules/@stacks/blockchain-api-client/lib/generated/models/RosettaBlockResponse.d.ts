/**
 * A BlockResponse includes a fully-populated block or a partially-populated block with a list of other transactions to fetch (other_transactions). As a result of the consensus algorithm of some blockchains, blocks can be omitted (i.e. certain block indexes can be skipped). If a query for one of these omitted indexes is made, the response should not include a Block object. It is VERY important to note that blocks MUST still form a canonical, connected chain of blocks where each block has a unique index. In other words, the PartialBlockIdentifier of a block after an omitted block should reference the last non-omitted block.

     * Some blockchains may require additional transactions to be fetched that weren't returned in the block response (ex: block only returns transaction hashes). For blockchains with a lot of transactions in each block, this can be very useful as consumers can concurrently fetch all transactions returned.
