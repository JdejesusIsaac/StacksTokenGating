/**
 * CoinChange is used to represent a change in state of a some coin identified by a coin_identifier. This object is part of the Operation model and must be populated for UTXO-based blockchains. Coincidentally, this abstraction of UTXOs allows for supporting both account-based transfers and UTXO-based transfers on the same blockchain (when a transfer is account-based, don't populate this model).
